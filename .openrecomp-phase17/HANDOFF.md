# OpenRecomp Phase 17 Handoff

## Summary
Phase 17 advances from the completed Phase-16 checkpoint (`a0c26e882ca65cfc84cbec78f7e787509a4992a3`). `P17-00` established the control plane and frozen baseline. `P17-01` now authenticates the Hercules disc fixture, mechanically locates `\\EX\\TITLE.;1` through validated ISO 9660 metadata, and ingests the bounded PS-X EXE using the frozen Phase-9 parser unchanged.

## Completed
- `P17-00` bootstrap gate passes with dual-run determinism.
- `P17-01` title ingestion gate passes with dual-run determinism.
- ISO 9660 reader validates sync, mode, Form-1 subheader, directory-record endian fields, and file geometry.
- Frozen Phase-16 boundary and canonical integrity gates remain intact.
- Public-safe evidence contains no private absolute paths, fixture bytes, or reconstructive payload material.

## Invariants
1. Commit `a0c26e882ca65cfc84cbec78f7e787509a4992a3` is the immutable ancestor.
2. Phase-1 through Phase-16 files and evidence are frozen.
3. No guest binary bytes committed to Git.
4. TITLE payload remains `NOT_DECODED` at `P17-01`.

## Next Action
Begin `P17-02` TITLE overlay IR ingestion contract when the implementation contract is supplied.
