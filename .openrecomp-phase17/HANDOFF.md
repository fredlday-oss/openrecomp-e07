# OpenRecomp Phase 17 Handoff

## Summary
Phase 17 advances from the completed Phase-16 checkpoint (`a0c26e882ca65cfc84cbec78f7e787509a4992a3`). `P17-00` established the control plane and frozen baseline. `P17-01` authenticates the Hercules disc fixture and ingests the bounded PS-X EXE. `P17-02` now authenticates the TITLE payload and emits a fail-closed, non-reconstructive decode/direct-control-flow projection with deterministic evidence.

## Completed
- `P17-00` bootstrap gate passes with dual-run determinism.
- `P17-01` title ingestion gate passes with dual-run determinism.
- ISO 9660 reader validates sync, mode, Form-1 subheader, directory-record endian fields, and file geometry.
- Frozen Phase-16 boundary and canonical integrity gates remain intact.
- Public-safe evidence contains no private absolute paths, fixture bytes, or reconstructive payload material.
- `P17-02` authoritative dual-run gate passes from the controller at commit `30a0b5a6effd3c84ab45782c998fba46e57a27da`.
- P17-02 evidence is deterministic across official runs and repeated controller invocations; source integrity and canonical frozen Phase-16 integrity pass.

## Invariants
1. Commit `a0c26e882ca65cfc84cbec78f7e787509a4992a3` is the immutable ancestor.
2. Phase-1 through Phase-16 files and evidence are frozen.
3. No guest binary bytes committed to Git.
4. The P17-01 `TITLE_PAYLOAD_DECODING_POLICY_V1=NOT_DECODED` marker remains historical to P17-01; P17-02 has authenticated decode evidence under `TITLE_IR_CONTRACT_V1=PASS`.

## Next Action
Begin P17-05 verified A0:0x43 Exec dispatch and causality. P17-04 emits a deterministic non-reconstructive block inventory from the authenticated P17-02 projection, with provenance digests and the emitted 0x800380A0 entry; execution remains deferred and all broad claims remain NOT_PROVEN.
